 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">As I know that some people
will ask me, here is a little history of the TWMC.</FONT></CENTER></P>
 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">On 9 March 1998, Kouichi
posted the following mail on TAIRA:</FONT></CENTER></P>
 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Dear TAIRAites,</FONT></CENTER></P>
 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I am looking for
groups that enjoy hiking and backpacking. I am from<BR>
Seattle and have some experiences of these activities. I used
to belong<BR>
to the group called the Mountaineers in Seattle. I would also
like to<BR>
enjoy these activities in Japan. If you know or belong to this
kind of<BR>
groups, please let me know.<BR>
Thank you for your help.<BR>
Kouichi Iwasaki&quot;</FONT></CENTER></P>
 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">I like the way he says
that he is from Seattle!!!</FONT></CENTER></P>
 <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">One of the people who
responded to this mail was John Payne, and a small group<BR>
went walking one weekend shortly after this. I already knew John
at this time,<BR>
and remembered Kouichi's mail, so he told me that he was meeting
Kouichi in<BR>
Tokyo to go to Kouichi's favourite outdoor shop in Yokohama, and
invited me to<BR>
come along. This was on Sunday 26 April, and on the train coming
back home, we<BR>
discussed setting up a walking club and coined the name TWMC.
On Wednesday 29<BR>
April, we had our first meeting in Gold Rush. Four people attended
that<BR>
meeting, and the first committee (Chairman - Kouichi, Secretary
- John,<BR>
Treasurer - me) was formed. On 9 May, John set up the mailing
list, and on 23<BR>
and 24 May, we went for our first walk. Within a couple of weeks,
we were<BR>
completely astonished at the interest we had generated.</FONT></CENTER></P>

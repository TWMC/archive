<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Who decided that Bjoern and I, we will go to
Minami Alps? I am not sure. Might be even myself... However, we
did. I think that the motto of this hike was &quot;the lucky one&quot;!
We started Saturday, at 4:00 am from the &quot;usual 7/11, Tadashi
saying that it is too early. We reached Tokyo, Tadashi: &quot;my
gush! It isn't even 5! We will be there too early!&quot; After
missing the road- Bjoern (navigating) was menaced to have his
name turned from &quot;Bjoern 1&quot; into &quot;Paul 2&quot;
- we still found the right direction and a necessary gas station.
I want to remind you that nothing is happening without a secret
sense! The &quot;wrong road&quot; (we thought at that time) proved
very helpful later. It seems that previous misfortunes on various
TWMC hikes should be remembered somewhere so they are not repeated
next time. However, fate cannot be always beaten, whatever precautions
one takes! We were on the way to the hike's starting point and
Tadashi was still saying &quot;we are lucky! It isn't even 7:30.
We are too early!&quot; Then it happened: there was a gate and
two guard men saying that there are no parking places at the starting
point of our hike, and we should take the bus. Thus Tadashi's
words echoed somewhere up there and we waited for the bus until
9:10, and started walking at 10:20...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It was not easy, it was quite steep, it was
a lack of condition (I'm speaking for myself!), it was something
that made Victor say &quot;we will reach the first hut and there
we will decide, during lunch break, who want to go to the top
and who to remain at 2250 m.&quot; I think that we must find an
honorific title for Victor. Something like &quot;TWMC's weak hikers
angel&quot; or &quot;TWMC's weak hikers motivator&quot;. However,
I believe that at least I managed to do - and survive - the hike
due to Victor. Thank you Victor! During the lunch we had good
and amazing happenings. The good one was the discussion about
the map time and the result that we actually were not too slow.
The amazing one was the discovery of the &quot;Swedish fireworks&quot;
as Niclas tried to light a camping burner. This happening was
photographically documented. Fortunately, Niclas did not managed
to light himself and the tents around us remained also intact.
We all decided to go further. Tadashi was still saying &quot;we
have plenty of time!&quot; The weather was fine - not too hot,
not too cold, the landscape was fine &shy; except for the slope
we were hiking on and the peak, which was hidden away by dark
clouds. I even managed to take some pictures of the colorful flowers
we've met. I'm thankful that Bjoern's proposal, to deny taking
pictures during TWMC hikes, was ignored. We were suddenly in clouds/fog
with low visibility, strong and chilly wind and thin air. OK,
the air was starting to be thin even before we reached the first
hut. The path was not too. Thank you Tadashi for help! I think
that everybody was happy to see the hut. In the hut we learned
that there are different opinions on the height of Kita-dake.
On T-shirts and handkerchiefs was written 3194m, some memorial
badge suggested 3192 m, while others claimed 3912m! The game the
wind played with the fog was teasing the photographers trying
to catch a glimpse of sunset. It was an intimate night, allowing
our group of 7 to share 3,5 futons. We were somehow concerned
for not having any idea about the whereabouts of Paul's group.
We started the second day with a &quot;memorial photograph&quot;
around the hut's fog bell. The climb in the fog was rewarded by
a splendid view as the wind cleared the summit. (May be Victor,
that the view you had two years ago was better, but this was mine
and it was gorgeous!) After a while first Paul and Neil, and than
one by one, Paul's group joined us. We looked around, took pictures,
enjoyed the clear sky and the view of Fuji san; put on sunscreen,
changed rain gear to shorts... and started descending. If one
doesn't have bad knees, descending sounds very easy! But it isn't
always like that; at least it wasn't for all. And then, there
are also other pleasures than &quot;jogging through the landscape&quot;
- looking, listening and searching for birds, taking pictures...</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">We found the map times going down from the summit
overly optimistic. Back at the cars we had to decide when and
how to return to Tsukuba. Tadashi wanted to spend some time in
an onsen, and start late to avoid the possible traffic jams, Victor
wanted to drive straight to Tsukuba, taking a longer route to
avoid Tokyo. Victor won. But the fate... Victor's car lost its
last droplet of break fluid and stopped just behind an onsen!
Since it was Sunday and evening, looking for a gas station which
sales such stuff proved difficult, but the &quot;navigation error&quot;
from the previous day helped. Tadashi and Bjoern this time found
the correct turn to route 20 they missed Saturday and on the &quot;wrong
road&quot; an open gas station which even had break fluid! Thus
Tadashi did not have an onsen, but Victor stopped near an onsen
for about one hour!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">After dinner we moved toward Tsukuba. Did I
say that Tadashi didn't miss any occasion to say how lucky we
are? He was right. We were lucky: no traffic jams, clear sky at
the summit, no major injuries excepting sun burns (I do not count
Les's heels), no running out of gas. Moreover Victor's car got
break fluid and Victor got the answer to the &quot;electronic
defect&quot; which caused a red hand-break related light to stay
on. But this one is another story, and Victor is a much better
storyteller...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Apart from Paul who was running around like
a headless chicken because of a last-minute hitch with his hike
plans we (Ascelin, Craig, Lester, Les and myself) had the relatively
easy task of meeting at Shinjuku station at 9pm ready to queue
for the best seats on the night train to the Alps. The night train
arrives at 11:20 so I had time to catch up on my train spotting,
a hobby I have neglected for the last 28 years. Luckily Lester
returned from his hat buying trip with a few beers so the time
passed pleasently and we had the best seats on the train.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We had to change trains in the middle of the
night and then take a bus to the start of the walk. The bus was
noteable for two things, firstly the price: 2,200 Yen for an hour
on a bus is surely a record even in Japan. Secondly, I managed
to fall asleep for the first time in the night and was woken by
a jolt. My initial reaction was that Paul must have been navigating
since the bus was no longer on a road but driving along a small
track. Apparently not - it arrived on time at our destination,
a hut in the middle of nowhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Our first days hike was quite easy: 5 hours,
climbing roughly 1500m to a mountain hut. The trail initially
followed a river crossing it several times on bridges that had
seen better days. I comforted myself in the knowledge that the
bridge was unlikely to collapse under my weight - although I weigh
20kg more than the average Japanese man, I am a feather weight
when it comes to hiking ... I only have a 30 litre rucksack, a
third of the size favoured by most of the hikers we met. The threat
of a 5m fall to the river below suddenly seemed less important
when a football-sized rock flew across my field of vision, narrowly
missing Craig's head. Time to move on. After that we left the
river behind us and starting climbing the valley side through
quite a pretty forest. It was about this time that Lester started
complaining of blisters, which on inspection were suprisingly
well developed for an hour of hiking. Luckily he was with a caring
group who drugged him up and lent him a second pair of socks before
setting off again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">By lunch time we had reached our hut. Having
not slept more than a couple of hours the night before it was
a case of &quot;when in Rome&quot; - I slept for 3 hours before
waking up to the pleasant suprise that the weather had now cleared
and there was a reasonable view of the surrounding mountains.
Unlike Tsukuba-san, according to the report in the Alien Times,
it was not the &quot;smell of the forest, like a woman's scent,
that brings the mountain to life&quot; - indeed to me mountain
tops in Japan tend to smell very much like the rest of Japan ..
of cigarettes. Instead it is the views that make the climb worthwhile
so we and especially the photographically-minded members of the
group made the most of last hours of light to admire the views.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Our leader, Paul, decided that to make up for
the short first day we had to cover 14 map hours the second day.
Most of the hikers we talked to thought this was impossible, but
we set off optimistically reasoning that since the weight of their
packs reduced them to walking like ducks, their advice was probably
not that valuable, especially since we didn't need to take cigarette
breaks or come to a concensus about which order to walk in and
who would carry the flag etc etc. Indeed by 12 o'clock we were
glad that we had got up so early since the perfect weather and
good visibility was quickly becoming swirling mist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The views on the second and the third day once
we had reached Kitadake were stunning. There were mountains as
far as the eye can see or that the humidity would allow us to
see (about 100km) including Fuji-san and several groups of mountains
that Paul helpfully told me were the Kita Alps, which are of course
to be visited in two weeks time on another Paul led trip and again
in the first weeked of September on a trip that I am organising,
if I have been persuaded to stay in Japan that long. It was also
quite nice to have a birds-eye view of the rest of the days walk
along a broad ridge. Not quite the 5* thriller we had been promised,
but it was pleasent enough anyway.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At lunch time on the second day we reached
a mountain hut were we decided to stay for the night to make the
most of the better weather the next day. Apparently Paul had forgotten
all his previous experiences in mountain huts when booking in
... he asked if we could be near the door so we would not wake
people up when we left at four in the morning. While commendable
in sentiment, his comment was going to have an ironic ring to
it 13 hours later at 3 the next morning.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Even when I have been in bed since 8 the previous
night, I am probably easy to annoy at 3 in the morning but our
fellow hikers did their best to make sure that they were as irritating
as possible. In the end they did too much and it was just funny
... the person that repacked their rucksack about 5 times individually
wrapping each sock in super-crinkle poly bags, the woman who had
a torch hanging around her neck which pointed everywhere apart
from where she was looking (presuming that she was not looking
into any of our eyes), the people who decided to check whether
it was possible to walk through the door without opening it ...
may noisy cars forever disturb their sleep and trains run through
the night a couple of yards from their house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We had been promised beautiful clear skies
the next morning, but as I suspected at the time this forecast
was more a guess than based on any weather forecast. So we set
off into the mist passing the early risers and cheerfully greeting
them with &quot;Sumimasen&quot; and &quot;Ohayo gozaimasu&quot;.
We were due to meet up with Tadashi's group of hikers on the summit
of Kitadake, which was still 5 and a half hours away so it was
full steam ahead. Soon the conditions slowed us down and we ended
up walking closely together tying not to lose anybody in the mist.
Even then we were still making good progress and by 8 we had reached
the hut where we had intended to spend the previous night.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Paul and I set off for the summit to meet with
Victor's group as quickly as possible leaving the others to finish
buying postcards and join us later. The rest of the hike has already
been well reported by Iulia so I will end my account here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It only remains for me to thank Paul for organising
the weekend and my fellow hikers for making it so enjoyable. See
you in the Kita Alps?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">PS: If anybody wants to buy a massage chair
I have one available. Ideal for easing away the stresses of the
day and aches from carrying rucksacks.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">by Victor Heese</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">As part of the story has been told by Iulia,
let me tell you the whole story - even though it is a little embarrassing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">_The Story_<BR>
The place where we parked the cars for the Kita-dake hike this
past weekend is at about 1500 metres. That's a long way to drive
up and a long way to come down. On the way down, it's a steep
and winding road so you need to use your brakes a lot. I was the
last of our 3 cars. As we were just about down to Kofu, after
using the brakes a lot, I noticed that my brake pedal was starting
to get a bit spongy. On a flat road, this might not be too serious
as you can use the hand brake to stop. But, on a downward slope,
it's not a very good thing. I was somewhat worried that we were
going to end up in the trunk of Arifa's car. I frantically flashed
my bright lights at the cars ahead as a signal to stop. For the
longest time, they didn't seem to notice, but finally they noticed
and pulled into the approach of some business. As it turned out,
it was an onsen. Talk about lucky. By the time that we stopped,
my brakes were completely useless and the place where we stopped
was an onsen. We checked the brake lines for leaks and couldn't
find any. We checked the brake fluid reservoir for brake fluid
and couldn't find any of that either.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Let me go back to about a year ago. I got this
car from my brother Jon about a year ago. I noticed that the brake
warning light stayed on even after I disengaged the hand brake.
I asked Jon about it and he told me that it was an electrical
problem - the hand brake sensor was broken. No problem - just
ignore the warning light. For about a year, I drove the car with
the light always on. Other than my regular driving, the car has
been to Bandai-san, Nikko, Oze, Okukujinantai-san and Myogi-san.
Never a problem - until this weekend when the brakes gave out
coming from Kita-dake.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Back to the present. The absence of brake fluid
was a little puzzling as we couldn't find any leaks in the brake
lines. We sent Tadashi, Bjorn and Iulia to find some fluid. Meanwhile,
the others had an onsen. About an hour later, Tadashi's crew came
back and we filled the reservoir with fluid. As there was a lot
of air in the brake lines, the brake pedal was still spongy so
I pumped the brake pedal for about 10 minutes. It started to firm
up and we thought we would test the brakes. Tadashi moved his
van well out of the way and everybody stood back. I got into the
car, started it and put the transmission into neutral (the car
was on a downslope so there was no need to engage the transmission).
Very slowly, I eased off the hand brake, and lo and behold, the
brake warning light went out.</FONT></P>

<P>We would like you to become aware of the safety issues while
walking / mountaineering with the TWMC, as all outdoor activities
have some element of risk. Due to problems with legal requirements
and responsibilities, it is essential that you agree to sign the
disclaimer of the TWMC that <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">ALL RISKS ARE
TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL NOT THE CLUB</FONT>. We will ask you to
sign a document on your first walk with the TWMC (which also includes
the date, address, full print of name, accident contact person,
etc..) which states that you understand that you may encounter
some risks while walking with the TWMC and that you shall try
your best to be prepared for such circumstances. The text from
this document is shown below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>We are always very happy to assist you in preparing for the
risks involved during walking. If you do not agree to sign the
document, then please refrain from joining our activities until
contacting and consulting a current committee member. In all cases,
the TWMC is here to attempt to help you have a great time in the
outdoors, but we cannot be responsible for your safety - this
responsibility can only be yours and yours alone. Please be sensible
and use your common sense to maximize your safety during any trip.</P>

<P>Similarly, all equipment either owned by the TWMC or other
persons must be used at the individual persons own risk on club
and/or private walks. Any equipment damaged or lost must be replaced
in full or paid for in full to the owner(s).</P>

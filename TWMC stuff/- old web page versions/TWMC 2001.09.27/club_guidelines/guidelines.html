<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">1. Introduction</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">These guidelines and rules have been designed
for you, a member or soon to be member of the TWMC as you are
already an important part of the TWMC. Initially, you may feel
a bit overwhelmed by the TWMC and what it has to offer, how to
get involved with the club and how to get started. We hope these
guidelines and information will help you get started and hope
to answer a few of the questions you may have about the TWMC and
what the TWMC has to offer you.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The TWMC is a young club that is evolving
and will continue to evolve. We hope to use the experience of
all our members to help provide a great atmosphere for all abilities
to enjoy the stunning scenery and walking in Japan. However, our
philosophies and purposes will never change...</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Purposes of the TWMC</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to explore and study the mountains, wilderness
  and walking areas of Japan</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to help preserve and encourage appreciation
  of the natural environment and beauty of Japan</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">to encourage a spirit of good fellowship
  among all lovers of outdoor life</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">2. Disclaimer</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We would like you to become aware of the
safety issues while walking / mountaineering with the TWMC, as
all outdoor activities have some element of risk. Due to problems
with legal requirements and responsibilities, it is essential
that you agree to sign the <A HREF="disclaimer.html">disclaimer</A>
of the TWMC that ALL RISKS ARE TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL NOT THE
CLUB. We will ask you to sign a document on your first walk with
the TWMC (which also includes the date, address, full print of
name, accident contact person, etc..) which states that you understand
that you may encounter some risks while walking with the TWMC
and that you shall try your best to be prepared for such circumstances.
We are always very happy to assist you in preparing for the risks
involved during walking. If you do not agree to sign the document,
then please refrain from joining our activities until contacting
and consulting a current committee member. In all cases, the TWMC
is here to attempt to help you have a great time in the outdoors,
but we cannot be responsible for your safety - this responsibility
can only be yours and yours alone. Please be sensible and use
your common sense to maximize your safety during any trip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Similarly, all equipment either owned by
the TWMC or other persons must be used at the individual persons
own risk on club and/or private walks. Any equipment damaged or
lost must be replaced in full or paid for in full to the owner(s).</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">3. TWMC Organisation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The TWMC is a non-profit organisation and
is run by a group (the committee) of volunteers whom are elected
(see section 6) every year (during August). The committee consists
of a Chairperson, Secretary, Treasurer, and any amount of Assistant
Organisers, whom are responsible for the smooth running of the
club, determining policy, controlling all expenditures, making
rules, and serving in the best interests of the entire club. There
are no casting votes within the committee, and any decisions taken
must be from a majority of committee members (abstentions are
valid).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Volunteers are the lifeblood of the TWMC.
We hope you become more involved with the club, and as you do
so, then please consider what contributions you may make as a
volunteer. Your enjoyment of, and connection to the club, will
be enhanced by your volunteer activities and we are always delighted
to hear from anyone willing to contribute to the club.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Roles of committee members</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Chairperson - maintains the smooth running
  of the club and acts as a contact point for outside enquiries
  (it has also been suggested that this position also enables the
  person to chat up any member of the opposite sex within the club).</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Secretary - maintain records of club activities,
  members, web pages, mailing list and publicity.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Treasurer - maintain all financial records
  and accounts of the club, collecting walking fees, signature
  on disclaimer for new members, list of people participating on
  walks and club equipment.</FONT>
  <LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Assistant Organisers - to assist and organise
  club events and walks.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">4. History</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The TWMC was initially started in May 1998
by Kouichi Iwasaki and John Payne, and were then joined by Paul
Reay, to form the first committee serving as Chairperson, Secretary
and Treasurer, respectively.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">5. Fees</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is no yearly subscription or membership
fee. Participants for each walk will be asked to pay 500 yen for
a one-day walk and 1000 yen for a multi-day walk. The walk fee
will be collected by the Treasurer or the Treasurer's representative
(usually the walk organizer). These fees pay for club equipment
needed for walking in Japan, organizational costs (such as telephone
charges), the TWMC end of year and summer barbeque parties and
any other items to support the generally agreed upon goals of
the committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The following persons are exempt from the
paying club fee for a specific walk:</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">1) The organiser of that walk,<BR>
  2) Car owners whose car is used on that walk. This does NOT apply
  to car trips to a nearby train station.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">6. Elections</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Elections will only take place for contested
positions (i.e. if more than one person applies) of Chairperson,
Secretary and/or Treasurer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Eligibility. Anyone who has taken part on
one or more walk within the club is eligible to vote.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Each committee person must be elected for
a fixed period of one year. Re-election of each individual can
continue indefinitely. Elections must be held every year at the
end of August. At this time, the change in committee would take
place directly after the annual BBQ meal. Nominations for the
committee must be posted 2 weeks before elections. Voting should
be conducted during two regular meetings of the club or by email/post
to the Secretary (who also decides the timings and length of voting)
, where electors will always have the option of voting for &quot;A.N.Other&quot;
as a fictitious person if none of the candidates are suitable.
The majority decision will be used for election results.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If a committee member leaves Japan or resigns
the position on the TWMC committee, then an election will be held
as soon as possible to replace that person on the committee. If
possible and having advanced notice of such events, co-operation
between the outgoing and incoming committee member should be promoted.
Any committee member leaving the TWMC must relinquish all information
and equipment belonging to the TWMC to his/her successor or a
suitable person within the committee.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">7. Group Sizes and Walking</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Group sizes should be dependent on conditions
and on the walk organisers and leaders. For group walking, PLEASE
stick together, where we realize this is dependent on conditions
- but generally people should be in either visible, hearing, or
timing distances and to be in constant communication with each
other. While walking, you are responsible for your own safety.
However, if you feel sick or cannot continue walking, please do
not hesitate to ask for other people*s help, especially the leader
of the group.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We will also rate the difficulty of each
walk on a 5-star scale as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">* = easy walk suitable for all age groups
and no special foot wear.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">** = medium walk suitable for all age groups,
boots recommended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">*** = medium walk, some strenuous activity,
good boots required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">**** = difficult walk, strenuous activity,
possibly some scrambling, good boots required.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">***** = very difficult walk, strenuous activity,
possibly some scrambling/snow walking, good boots required and
possibly crampons/boot spikes</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">New walkers. If you are an inexperienced
walker, we suggest you to try the easy walks initially, and then
try more difficult walks later when you have gained some experience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Skill levels in a group. If people joining
a walk have different skill / fitness levels, then the group leader
will suggest that the group be divided into smaller groups (minimum
of 3 people) with similar skill / fitness levels. Each group should
have an appointed leader, a deputy leader if appropriate, and
at least one map and compass.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">8. Comments about the TWMC</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Please make sure that any comments about
the TWMC should be emailed / posted to all committee members.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">9. Transport</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The expenses for travelling must be taken
care of within individual cars. The TWMC is not responsible for
any costs involved during transport.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">If any accidents occur while travelling,
then please be collaborative and attempt to help the driver with
the situation. However, the driver is responsible for any accidents
using private or rental cars. Individual people should have their
own form of insurance or be covered by the vehicle insurance.
The TWMC is not responsible for any vehicle or person, and can
provide no assistance for such costs.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">10. Smoking</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Smoking is not permitted in any form of
transport used by the TWMC unless everyone present agrees.</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">11. Environmental Day</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">We would like to put something back into
the environment by performing an environmental day(s) - this would
involve either 1 or 2 days helping maintain the environment in
a way suitable to the aims of the TWMC (e.g. repairing footpaths).
The TWMC (the secretary) will actively seek information and attempt
to contact appropriate organisations / agencies for information
to organise such an environmental event (e.g. contact with the
environmental organisation &quot;Friends of the Earth&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">12. Discipline</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In order to promote the respect and safety
of all members when walking, the committee reserves the power
to take the necessary action (suspension or expulsion from the
TWMC) against any member who does any act while walking with the
TWMC which is obnoxious/repugnant or endangers or is likely to
endanger the safety of him/her, or any other TWMC member, or any
other person, or any other animal. Any member accused of performing
any such act will have the following rights: to have the full
details of the specific act alleged; and to have reasonable opportunity
to put his/her case orally to the committee at a meeting in private
if he/she so wishes. Following the meeting, the committee will
decide on the action to take and will notify all members of the
TWMC within 1 week of the meeting.</FONT></P>

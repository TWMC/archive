In that press release, the TWMC announcedthat one</P><P>of their members, Victor Heese, had died while hiking on a TWMCsponsored</P><P>walk in the North Alps, Nagano prefecture, on the weekend of July18-20.</P><P>In this latest press release, the TWMC retracted their previousstatement</P><P>and said that Mr. Heese, much to their surprise, had not in factdied.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>When asked why the TWMC had made such an outrageous andobviously</P><P>premature statement, Payne replied that although Heese had gone ona few</P><P>previous walks with the club, he was in no way prepared for sucha</P><P>strenuous trip. "In the minds of the TWMC executive, this timeVictor had</P><P>bitten off more than he could chew and we felt it was ineveryone's</P><P>interest to declare what we considered to be a foregoneconclusion," said</P><P>Payne. When asked how this could possibly be in everyone'sinterest Payne</P><P>stated that "As Monday was a holiday and we didn't think thatVictor would</P><P>make it through the first 2 days of the trip, we could hold anearly wake</P><P>at Victor's favourite hangout, the Gold Rush, to commemorate hisnoble but</P><P>disastrous effort. We figured, given Victor's love of a goodparty, that</P><P>would be what he would have wanted. We never imagined that the oldfart</P><P>was going to make it." When asked if the TWMC was the kind of clubthat</P><P>gave its members special nicknames and if "old fart" was Heese's,Payne</P><P>responded "Not really. That's what we call him behind his back.But we</P><P>mean it affectionately. No, really!"</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Club treasurer, Paul Reay, added that given Heese's vices and thathis</P><P>emergency medical kit consisted of a half liter of 'medicinal'scotch and</P><P>a pack of Marlboros, he could have gone at any time of heartfailure,</P><P>respiratory disease, liver dysfunction or terminal baldness, butthat</P><P>probability suggested that it would be this weekend. Hecontinued,</P><P>"Personally, I had the old fart down for syphilis on the 18th. Imean that</P><P>affectionately. Really!" When asked to elaborate, Reay refusedcomment but</P><P>it has been learned from anonymous sources that the TWMC hadcreated a</P><P>pool in which  members guessed the date and means of Heese's deathwith</P><P>the winner to receive Heese's new backpack and 2 free futurewalks.</P><P>Sources also claim that life insurance had been taken out on Heeseby the</P><P>TWMC. When asked to confirm this, Reay refused comment but didadmit that</P><P>the TWMC had in fact been looking to purchase new medical suppliesand a</P><P>tent.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Further investigation has determined that the TWMC had planned a'walk' in</P><P>the mountains of Nagano and that 9 members had gone. Four members,3 women</P><P>and 1 man, took a North to South route from Nakabusa Sparendezvousing</P><P>with the second group at Yarigatake on the second night of thetrip. The</P><P>second group, consisting of 5 male members including Heese, took amore</P><P>difficult route starting from Kamikochi that included climbing</P><P>Okuhotaka-dake (Japan's 3rd highest mountain) and Yarigadake(Japan's 4th</P><P>highest mountain) as well as 5 other peaks. Though inexperienced,Heese</P><P>seems to have survived this difficult trek.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Although this second route was significantly more dangerous thanthe</P><P>first, which was much more appropriate for an inexperienced hiker,sources</P><P>say that Heese joined the more difficult hike and even began togleefully</P><P>sing the Village People song "Macho Man" as he signed his name andgave</P><P>his blood type and dental records to organizers.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>When reached for comment, members of the second group wereunanimously</P><P>surprised. Andreas said, "Although he was not as sure-footed as amountain</P><P>goat, the old fart made up for it by by being as grumpy as a billygoat.</P><P>That is said affectionately. Really!" Negishi-san commented "Hepart</P><P>Japanese must be. The old fart ga went to climbing with stubbornendurance</P><P>and suffering. Affectionately that I mean. Honto ni!" Davidstated,</P><P>"Tabernacle! Le viellieux fart did not seem to mind even when zelittle</P><P>old grannies passed him. I mean zat affectionnment. Vraiment!" Theonly</P><P>apparent dissent came from Thomas who said, "I should have joinedthe</P><P>women's group. It was no fun sleeping beside the old fart. But ofcourse,</P><P>I mean that affectionately. No. I'm serious."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Members of the other group were also contacted for their comments.Sylvie</P><P>said, " Asti! I could not believe my eyes when I saw him walkingto the</P><P>lodge at Yarigadake! Zough I had only met him ze night beforelast, I was</P><P>sure that I would not see ze old fart again. I must say zataffectionately</P><P>because I do not really know him. Really!" Miho-san, out ofpoliteness</P><P>refused all comment, although she did admit to thinking that shewas</P><P>seeing a ghost as Heese approached the lodge. Franz also seemedsurprised</P><P>at Heese's appearance. "Gott im Himmel! I chose das easy routebecause I</P><P>remember Oze and I did not vant to carry das alte fart's body downza</P><P>mountain. But I mean dat with affection." Laure recounted how whenHeese</P><P>reached the summit of Yarigatake everyone broke into applausecausing a</P><P>rockslide that killed 3 Japanese and 1 American climber. "I'm surethe</P><P>Japanese will be missed," she said.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Heese was unavailable for comment, however his doctor did say thathad</P><P>Heese been conscious, it might have been appropriate to use MarkTwain's</P><P>famous quote upon hearing of the premature announcement of his owndeath.</P><P>"But, he's probably not that clever, even when he is conscious,"the</P><P>doctor continued.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Also at the hospital was Heese's brother, Jon Heese. He commentedthat "My</P><P>brother's breathing seems a little less desperate now that we havehim on</P><P>the ventilator. The scotch IV drip also seems to be making adifference."</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Although family and friends were initially upset at the TWMC'spremature</P><P>death announcement, plans for a defamation of character lawsuithave been</P><P>dropped as it was discovered, upon careful examination, that Heesedoesn't</P><P>actually have a character....</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><HR></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><U>Assorted Pictures (many thanks to Laure Bourgeois!)</U></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Shinkuku eki - Picnic in Shinjuku station, at about ten o'clock atnight.

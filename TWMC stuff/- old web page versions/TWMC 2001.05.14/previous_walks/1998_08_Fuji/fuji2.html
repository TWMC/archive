<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Saturday began early, but everybody was there
in time, we met Agnieszka at Arakawaoki Station and Emma S. and
companions at Shijuku. The ticket office and the bus stop were
easily found. Heavy traffic on the express way, stop and go, time
to sleep. We arrived with a minor delay at 11:50 (scheduled arrival
time was 10:10), Hubert had to wait for quite a while. As suggested
by various hiking experts, we took a one-hour break to get used
to the altitude (and to get a first idea of the &quot;crowd&quot;
we could expect on our way up), had lunch and got ready for climbing
at 1:00pm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We arrived at our destination &quot;Fuji-san-Hoteru&quot;
at about 5:00pm (+/-). The first technical challenge was to prevent
Emma D and Bronwyn to make the top straight away (Thanks to Emma
S). Our dinner was beef curry - the menu was written not only
on the door but also on a large bucket that was used as trash
can. The good news: the portions were small. 8:30 pm or so, after
a beer,and maybe after surviving a visit to the toilet: Goto futon.
They were a bit sticky, quite a bit, actually. Anyway, it would
have been much worse at higher temperatures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The night was short as the one before: We got
up at 1:00am, received our lunch pack and tried to gather at the
entrance. People everywhere, and it was already difficult to get
out of the hut. The line of climbers passed right in front of
the door. At about 2:00, after a cup of coffee, everybody was
ready to queue for the top, and it took some two hours and a couple
of minutes to get there. It wasn't too cold on top of Fuji-san
but windy enough to make you freeze during one hour of waiting.
Time for watching the activities at the shrine: climbers getting
stamps, having their sticks burned or buying &quot;Eternal Luck&quot;.
Finally, the sun showed up - not a very special sunrise, with
clouds at the horizon, or special maybe because hundreds or thousands
of people around you are looking in the same direction? I'm sure
everybody's seen better ones before (I suspect that Japanese and
Westerners don't see the same thing watching this sunrise, gomenasai).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Immediately after sunrise the crowd started
to move - traffic jam around the shops. On our walk along the
rim we admired the shadow of Fuji-san and had breakfast near the
weather station. The post office was easy to find, unfortunately
closed since August 20.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We began our descent on the Gotemba route around
8:00am and had a break at one of the huts. It's a fast and easy
way down; the lower part, still steep enough to make you &quot;brake&quot;
all the way down, could have been a bit shorter. After a short
rest at Gotemba 5th Station, we took Taxis to Gotemba Station
where we dropped our postcards. Due to a regrettable misunderstanding
we lost track of Hubert who was queueing for his travel information
at the JR counter. We had lunch in a restaurant across the square
and took the train(s) back home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">What I keep as a souvenir is not the sunrise,
but rather the endless chain of lights heading for the top. Paul
Hunt: &quot;Nowadays people climb Fuji-san for the fun and challenge
of of climbing Japan's highest peak, but a few pilgrims may be
seen ...&quot;. I've seen a lot of pilgrims, not in the traditional
white clothes and straw sandals, and most of them not even being
aware of their &quot;pilgrim&quot; status.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Doing this hike outside climbing/pilgrimeering
season must be a completely different adventure, and I'm tempted
to try that one as well - knowing that only fools climb Fuji-san
more than once. I guess the post man doesn't care. Why should
I?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Many thanks to all the participants, and especially
to Miho. I hope you all enjoyed this trip as I did.</FONT></P>

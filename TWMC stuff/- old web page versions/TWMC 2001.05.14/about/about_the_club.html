      <FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">The Tsukuba Walking and Mountaineering
      Club (TWMC) was founded in May 1998 and has already visited many
      places in Japan like Fuji-san, the North and South Alps and of
      course Tsukuba-san, to name but a few. Our aim is to provide
      walks at all levels to give everyone the chance to experience
      the natural beauty of Japan, and of course to also leave no onsen
      untested!</FONT></CENTER></P>

      <P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">There is no formal membership
      and consequently no regular membership fee, you automatically
      become a member by joining one of the club's hikes. <BR>
      To cover the cost of maps and club equipment we do, however,
      ask hike participants to pay a club fee of 500 Yen for daytrips
      and 1000 Yen for longer walks.</FONT></CENTER></P>

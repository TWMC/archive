Ltd., and they have been excellent.  You can do everything via email in ENGLISH to Mr. Motoji Eguchi-san : </P><P>"Eguchi-san, Turtle Travel Co.,LTD" <A HREF= "mailto: turtle@mx5.meshnet.or.jp">turtle@mx5.meshnet.or.jp</A><P>Payment can be done via bank draft (their preferred method) or cash or visa (with a 3% surcharge).They have always given me excellent service, and Eguchi-san has always got back to me within one day about travel arrangements (private or business). They are willing to do any international or domestic travel arrangements, and have always tried to get me the best deals going.  Eg. flight back to the UK next month: Checked out various on-line prices and they were mostly over 200,000 yen. The cheapest Turtle offered was 62,000 yen!!! </P></BODY></HTML>

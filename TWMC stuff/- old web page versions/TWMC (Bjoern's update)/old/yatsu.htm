According to John, who went there last weekend, theYatsugatake area offers "fantastic walking" and also beautiful autumncolours. So it sounds like a great mountain hike, and it will alsoprobably be the last one until next spring ! There are possibilities fortwo-day and three-day walks. Doing a three-day hike would of course meantaking Monday 1st November off work. Accomodation would be in mountainhuts, which are still open at this time of year, and transport by trainand bus, or taxi. Therefore all you need are good walking boots and warm(and waterproof) clothes. Please let me know as soon as possible  if youare interested in coming, and whether you intend to do the two-day or thethree-day walk. By next Wednesday would be good, even if you're not 100%sure that you'll join the walk !</P><P><A HREF="mailto:laure@nirim.go.jp">Laure</A></P><P>Ê</P><P>Ê</P><P>Ê</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>

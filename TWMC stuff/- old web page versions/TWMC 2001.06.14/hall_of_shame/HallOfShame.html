<H2><CENTER>The &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; has several functions.</CENTER></H2>

<H2><CENTER>For one, it is meant as a memorial to distinguished
hike organisers, <BR>
including the most embarrassing photos we could find. <BR>
<BR>
There is also a brief history of the TWMC.</CENTER></H2>

(by Paul Reay)</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">As I know that some people will ask
me, here is a little history of the TWMC.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">On 9 March 1998, Kouichi posted the
following mail on TAIRA:</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Dear TAIRAites,</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">&quot;I am looking for groups that
enjoy hiking and backpacking. I am from<BR>
Seattle and have some experiences of these activities. I used
to belong<BR>
to the group called the Mountaineers in Seattle. I would also
like to<BR>
enjoy these activities in Japan. If you know or belong to this
kind of<BR>
groups, please let me know.<BR>
Thank you for your help.<BR>
Kouichi Iwasaki&quot;</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">I like the way he says that he is from
Seattle!!!</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">One of the people who responded to
this mail was John Payne, and a small group<BR>
went walking one weekend shortly after this. I already knew John
at this time,<BR>
and remembered Kouichi's mail, so he told me that he was meeting
Kouichi in<BR>
Tokyo to go to Kouichi's favourite outdoor shop in Yokohama, and
invited me to<BR>
come along. This was on Sunday 26 April, and on the train coming
back home, we<BR>
discussed setting up a walking club and coined the name TWMC.
On Wednesday 29<BR>
April, we had our first meeting in Gold Rush. Four people attended
that<BR>
meeting, and the first committee (Chairman - Kouichi, Secretary
- John,<BR>
Treasurer - me) was formed. On 9 May, John set up the mailing
list, and on 23<BR>
and 24 May, we went for our first walk. Within a couple of weeks,
we were<BR>
completely astonished at the interest we had generated.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Luckily, there were no serious injuries
yet on TWMC trips. In fact, only 2 are worth mentioning.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Paul popped his knee on the Oze trip
of 1998, and he promised to provide MRI scans of his knee for
this page.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">The other one is Bj&ouml;rns fall on
the 2001 downhill skiing trip. He managed to fall on the easiest
part of <BR>
the easiest slope of the Alts resort on Bandai-san, where in fact
the only difficulty is not to stop.<BR>
It was said that he was looking at some cute Japanese girls but
this account was denied by Bj&ouml;rn. It is <BR>
undeniable, however, that he had a second fall at the very same
place a few descents later when a really <BR>
cute snowboarding girl bumped into him from behind.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Be this as it may, below is an MRI
scan of his right upper arm, a vertical slice from the front (left)
to the back (right). <BR>
After some confusion (the doctors initially scared Bj&ouml;rn
shitless by diagnosing he had torn his rotator cuff) it <BR>
turned out that the arm was &quot;only&quot; broken after all,
though in a somewhat awkward way. You can see that <BR>
a chunk broke out off the upper arm bone opposite to the joint
with the shoulder. The white blob in the <BR>
centre of the image is the bone, the broken out piece is visible
to the upper left of it.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1">Also note the interesting back translation
of Bj&ouml;rns name from Katakana into Romaji. <BR>
Klotz Bj&ouml;rn became Kurotutu Biyorun.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P>hello hikers,</P>

<P>i am organising a 2 day trip to hakone at the end of november.
since hakone is a popular holiday destination i would like to book
our accomodation soon, so this walk needs to be organised fairly
quickly.</P>

<P>i have included a map (SEE&nbsp;BELOW) of hakone (i hope you can
all open it...if not let me know and i'll send it a format other than
jpeg) showing a proposed route (dark red). X marks the beginning and
end, at gora. although i will discuss the route in the clockwise
direction, it doesn't really matter which way we do the walk.</P>

<P>the first day involves walking up a sulphurous mountainside (lazy
people can catch a cable car) and then across three mountain peaks to
motohakone (or hakone). from the last peak we can either walk or
catch a ropeway and then walk to motohakone (or hakone). this walk is
pretty much as described in paul hunt's book, and should take less
than 5 hours. there are several onsens in hakone/motohakone, a visit
to one of which i am sure we will need after the sulphur.</P>

<P>for the second day there are a couple of choices. on the map i
have indicated a boat trip from motohakone/hakone to togendai; it is
also possible to walk around lake ashi (two routes are shown in
pink). i suspect we will not have time to walk.... but i leave the
option open. then, from togendai we walk across several mountains and
arrive back at gora. i think the route i have shown will take at
least 7 hours, so it's a fairly long day.</P>

<P>the pampas grass fields at sengokubara (marked with a pink
question mark) have been recommended to me, so we could change the
walking route to include these; however this would mean omitting a
few of the mountain peaks.</P>

<P>if anyone has been on these routes or to these areas, i would be
very happy to get some advice.....actually, input from anyone
interested in this trip would be appreciated. speaking of interested
people, if you do want to come can you let me know soon?</P>

<P>hope you all have a fun day,</P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Welcome - The Safety Page<BR>
         <BR>
         </B></FONT>Please view our safety information for walking.
         It may keep you alive! A little bit of knowledge used with
         common sense can go along way... <FONT COLOR="#CC0000">It
         must also be made aware that all walkers walk at their own
         risk.</FONT></P>
         
         <P>We don't want safety to become a difficult task that it
         stops the enjoyment we all seek from a trip into the
         countryside. However it is foolish going out without some
         idea of how to help prevent disasters from happening. To
         this end the Club has drawn up the following Safety Guidance
         Policy. This contains a list of recommendations that we hope
         will help while walking in Japan.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>1. Club Interests</P>
         
         <P>It is in the interests of Club safety that a clear policy
         be established. Any member deemed acting against Club
         interests as described in this policy may face appropriate
         action by the Club.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>2. Equipment recommended to be carried on any Club
         Hike</P>
         
         <P>By all Members</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>Waterproofs - at least a jacket/poncho, and
            preferably over-trousers. NO JEANS (as they may cause
            hypothermia when wet!).</LI>
            
            <LI>Good walking boots - especially if you want to do
            higher walks.</LI>
            
            <LI>Food and water - sufficient for meals. Chocolate bars
            are good for energy.</LI>
            
            <LI>Spare Clothes - minimum a spare jumper and
            socks.</LI>
            
            <LI>First aid kit.</LI>
            
            <LI>Whistle.</LI>
            
            <LI>Torch.</LI>
            
            <LI>Survival Bag.</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>By Leaders and Deputy Leaders.</P>
         
         <UL>
            <LI>Map and map case, compass, whistle, first aid kit,
            torch, survival bag.</LI>
         </UL>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>3. Hike rules</P>
         
         <P>All decisions on Hikes will be made by the designated
         Hike Leader. Hike Leaders will be a Club Committee member or
         their designated appointees. For large groups each leader
         shall appoint a deputy leader to aid them. The Hikes Leader
         agrees to lead hikes on the basis that their advice should
         be followed as if they were in your position.</P>
         
         <P>Group sizes will be kept to a maximum of about 10 during
         summer hikes, decreasing to about 7 on the harder winter
         hikes. Larger groups can become cumbersome and dangerous.
         This however will not mean people will be forced to do walks
         above their ability. The minimum size will be not less than
         2/3, depending on abilities.</P>
         
         <P>Members must consider whether they are fit enough,
         competent enough and confident enough before leaving to do a
         particular walk. If unsure please seek the advice of an
         experienced member. If in the opinion of the Hike Leader a
         member is not competent, fit or confident, then that member
         may be asked to find a more suitable plan.</P>
         
         <P>Before setting out on the Hike, the Hike Leader must make
         a record of the group names and route. One copy to be
         carried on the hike, the other to be left at base.</P>
         
         <P>No member may leave a group without consulting the Hike
         Leader.</P>
         
         <P>Stick together - try not to lag behind but do tell the
         leader if the pace is too fast. The aim is to walk at the
         pace of the slowest group member. If anything is bothering
         you, feet hurt, pace too quick etc., please tell the other
         group members and hopefully it can be sorted out.</P>
         
         <P>During the winter months the hills can be more beautiful,
         but with that beauty comes danger. Winter walking can be
         more difficult, more dangerous and much more tiring than
         attempting the same walk under different conditions. Policy
         regarding fitness, competance and confidence levels is that
         much more important during these months.</P>
         
         <P>It must be emphasised that the Hikes Leader is there to
         help your enjoyment of the countryside. He/She will not be
         able to help you if you don't let them know if anything is
         wrong.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>4. Travelling, Tours and Expeditions</P>
         
         <P>Travelling to and from events the driver is in charge.
         His/her decisions are final and must be respected.</P>
         
         <P>All the above statements concerning Hikes, route cards,
         etc., apply in respect to Hikes undertaken whilst on a Tour
         or an Expedition.</P>
         
         <P>In case of a conflict of interests, a majority vote of
         the present committee members will be called. This decision
         is final and contravention of this decision is deemed
         against the interests of the club.</P>
         
         <P>&nbsp;</P>
         
         <P>5.General</P>
         
         <P>Use your common sense: be aware of your environment,
         check weather forecasts beforehand. If you are for any
         reason in doubt or unsure - let the Hike Leader know of your
         concerns.</P>

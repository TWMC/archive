<P>Edition 1b (October 1998)</P>

<P>Produced by: John Payne (Secretary), Kouichi Iwasaki
(Chairperson), Paul Reay (Treasurer)</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>1.  Introduction</B></P>

<P>These guidelines and rules have been designed for you, a member or
soon to be member of the TWMC as you are already an important part of
the TWMC. Initially, you may feel a bit overwhelmed by the TWMC and
what it has to offer, how to get involved with the club and how to
get started. We hope these guidelines and information will help you
get started and hope to answer a few of the questions you may have
about the TWMC and what the TWMC has to offer you.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The TWMC is a young club that is evolving and will continue to
evolve. We hope to use the experience of all our members to help
provide a great atmosphere for all abilities to enjoy the stunning
scenery and walking in Japan. However, our philosophies and purposes
will never change...</P>

<P> </P>

<P><B>Purposes of the TWMC</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>  to explore and study the mountains, wilderness and walking
   areas of Japan</LI>
   
   <LI> to help preserve and encourage appreciation of the natural
   environment and beauty of Japan</LI>
   
   <LI> to encourage a spirit of good fellowship among all lovers of
   outdoor life</LI>
</UL>

<P></P>

<P><B>2.  Disclaimer </B></P>

<P>We would like you to become aware of the safety issues while
walking / mountaineering with the TWMC, as all outdoor activities
have some element of risk. Due to problems with legal requirements
and responsibilities, it is essential that you agree to sign the
<A HREF="disclaimer.htm" TARGET="page">disclaimer</A> of the TWMC that ALL RISKS ARE TAKEN BY THE INDIVIDUAL NOT
THE CLUB. We will ask you to sign a document on your first walk with
the TWMC (which also includes the date, address, full print of name,
accident contact person, etc..) which states that you understand that
you may encounter some risks while walking with the TWMC and that you
shall try your best to be prepared for such circumstances. We are
always very happy to assist you in preparing for the risks involved
during walking. If you do not agree to sign the document, then please
refrain from joining our activities until contacting and consulting a
current committee member. In all cases, the TWMC is here to attempt
to help you have a great time in the outdoors, but we cannot be
responsible for your safety - this responsibility can only be yours
and yours alone. Please be sensible and use your common sense to
maximize your safety during any trip.</P>

<P>Similarly, all equipment either owned by the TWMC or other persons
must be used at the individual persons own risk on club and/or
private walks. Any equipment damaged or lost must be replaced in full
or paid for in full to the owner(s).</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>3.  TWMC Organisation</B></P>

<P>The TWMC is a non-profit organisation and is run by a group (the
committee) of volunteers whom are elected (see section 6) every year
(during August). The committee consists of a Chairperson, Secretary,
Treasurer, and any amount of Assistant Organisers, whom are
responsible for the smooth running of the club, determining policy,
controlling all expenditures, making rules, and serving in the best
interests of the entire club. There are no casting votes within the
committee, and any decisions taken must be from a majority of
committee members (abstentions are valid).</P>

<P>Volunteers are the lifeblood of the TWMC. We hope you become more
involved with the club, and as you do so, then please consider what
contributions you may make as a volunteer. Your enjoyment of, and
connection to the club, will be enhanced by your volunteer activities
and we are always delighted to hear from anyone willing to contribute
to the club.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Roles of committee members</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Chairperson - maintains the smooth running of the club and
   acts as a contact point for outside enquiries (it has also been
   suggested that this position also enables the person to chat up
   any member of the opposite sex within the club).</LI>
   
   <LI>Secretary - maintain records of club activities, members, web
   pages, mailing list and publicity.</LI>
   
   <LI>Treasurer - maintain all financial records and accounts of the
   club, collecting walking fees, signature on disclaimer for new
   members, list of people participating on walks and club
   equipment.</LI>
   
   <LI>Assistant Organisers - to assist and organise club events and
   walks.</LI>
</UL>

<P></P>

<P><B>4.  History</B></P>

<P>The TWMC was initially started in May 1998 by Kouichi Iwasaki and
John Payne, and were then joined by Paul Reay, to form the first
committee serving as Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer,
respectively.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>5.  Fees</B></P>

<P>The Treasurer or Treasurer`s representative will collect a fee for
each walk (500yen per day, 1000yen maximum). The fee will pay for
equipment needed for walking in Japan, and for items to support
generally agreed goals of the committee. There is no subscription or
membership fee for the TWMC.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>6.  Elections</B></P>

<P>Elections will only take place for contested positions (i.e. if
more than one person applies) of Chairperson, Secretary and/or
Treasurer. </P>

<P>Eligibility. Anyone who has taken part on one or more walk within
the club is eligible to vote.</P>

<P>Each committee person must be elected for a fixed period of one
year. Re-election of each individual can continue indefinitely.
Elections must be held every year at the end of August. At this time,
the change in committee would take place directly after the annual
BBQ meal. Nominations for the committee must be posted 2 weeks before
elections. Voting should be conducted during two regular meetings of
the club or by email/post to the Secretary (who also decides the
timings and length of voting) , where electors will always have the
option of voting for "A.N.Other" as a fictitious person if none of
the candidates are suitable. The majority decision will be used for
election results. </P>

<P>If a committee member leaves Japan or resigns the position on the
TWMC committee, then an election will be held as soon as possible to
replace that person on the committee. If possible and having advanced
notice of such events, co-operation between the outgoing and incoming
committee member should be promoted. Any committee member leaving the
TWMC must relinquish all information and equipment belonging to the
TWMC to his/her successor or a suitable person within the
committee.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>7.  Group Sizes and Walking</B></P>

<P>Group sizes should be dependent on conditions and on the walk
organisers and leaders. For group walking, PLEASE stick together,
where we realize this is dependent on conditions - but generally
people should be in either visible, hearing, or timing distances and
to be in constant communication with each other. While walking, you
are responsible for your own safety. However, if you feel sick or
cannot continue walking, please do not hesitate to ask for other
people*s help, especially the leader of the group.</P>

<P>We will also rate the difficulty of each walk on a 5-star scale as
follows:</P>

<P>* = easy walk suitable for all age groups and no special foot
wear.</P>

<P>** = medium walk suitable for all age groups, boots
recommended.</P>

<P>*** = medium walk, some strenuous activity, good boots
required.</P>

<P>**** = difficult walk, strenuous activity, possibly some
scrambling, good boots required.</P>

<P>***** = very difficult walk, strenuous activity, possibly some
scrambling/snow walking, good boots required and possibly
crampons/boot spikes</P>

<P></P>

<P>New walkers. If you are an inexperienced walker, we suggest you to
try the easy walks initially, and then try more difficult walks later
when you have gained some experience.</P>

<P>Skill levels in a group. If people joining a walk have different
skill / fitness levels, then the group leader will  suggest that the
group be divided into smaller groups (minimum of 3 people) with
similar skill / fitness levels. Each group should have an appointed
leader, a deputy leader if appropriate, and at least one map and
compass.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>8.  Comments about the TWMC</B></P>

<P>Please make sure that any comments about the TWMC should be
emailed / posted to all committee members.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>9.  Transport</B></P>

<P>The expenses for travelling must be taken care of within
individual cars. The TWMC is not responsible for any costs involved
during transport.</P>

<P>If any accidents occur while travelling, then please be
collaborative and attempt to help the driver with the situation.
However, the driver is responsible for any accidents using private or
rental cars. Individual people should have their own form of
insurance or be covered by the vehicle insurance. The TWMC is not
responsible for any vehicle or person, and can provide no assistance
for such costs.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>10.  Smoking</B></P>

<P>Smoking is not permitted in any form of transport used by the TWMC
unless everyone present agrees.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>11.  Environmental Day</B></P>

<P>We would like to put something back into the environment by
performing an environmental day(s) - this would involve either 1 or 2
days helping maintain the environment in a way suitable to the aims
of the TWMC (e.g. repairing footpaths). The TWMC (the secretary) will
actively seek information and attempt to contact appropriate
organisations / agencies for information to organise such an
environmental event (e.g. contact with the environmental organisation
"Friends of the Earth").</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>12.  Discipline</B></P>

<P>In order to promote the respect and safety of all members when
walking, the committee reserves the power to take the necessary
action (suspension or expulsion from the TWMC) against any member who
does any act while walking with the TWMC which is obnoxious/repugnant
or endangers or is likely to endanger the safety of him/her, or any
other TWMC member, or any other person, or any other animal. Any
member accused of performing any such act will have the following
rights: to have the full details of the specific act alleged; and to
have reasonable opportunity to put his/her case orally to the
committee at a meeting in private if he/she so wishes. Following the
meeting, the committee will decide on the action to take and will
notify all members of the TWMC within 1 week of the meeting.</P>

<P><H3>The Tsukuba Walking
and Mountaineering Club (TWMC) was founded in May 1998 and has already visited many places in Japan, including Fuji-san, the South Alps, Chiba and Tsukuba-san.  Our aim is to provide walks at all levels to give everyone the chance to experience the natural beauty of Japan, and of course to also leave no onsen untested!  Browse through our pages for <A HREF= "guidelines.htm" TARGET = "page">further club information</A> and  <A HREF= "advice.html" TARGET = "page">hiking advice</A>, and to see <A HREF= "walksarchive.html" TARGET = "page">where we have been</A>, <A HREF= "walkslist.html" TARGET = "page">where we are going</A>, and <A HREF= "gallery.html" TARGET = "page">photos</A> from various trips and events.

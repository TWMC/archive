The ticketoffice and the bus stop were easily found. Heavy traffic on the expressway, stop and go, time to sleep. We arrived with a minor delay at 11:50(scheduled arrival time was 10:10), Hubert had to wait for quite a while.As suggested by various hiking experts, we took a one-hour break to getused to the altitude (and to get a first idea of the "crowd" we could expecton our way up), had lunch and got ready for climbing at 1:00pm.<br><img SRC="schaf.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 height=120 width=120 align=LEFT><p>We arrived at our destination "Fuji-san - Hoteru" at about 5:00pm (+/-).The first technical challenge was to prevent Emma D. and Bronwyn to makethe top straight away (thanks to Emma S.). Our dinner was beef curry -the menu was written not only on the door but also on a large bucket thatwas used as trash can. The good news: the portions were small. 8:30 pmor so, after a beer, and maybe after surviving a visit to the toilet: Gotofuton. They were a bit sticky, quite a bit, actually. Anyway, it wouldhave been much worse at higher temperatures.<p>The night was short as the one before: We got up at 1:00am, receivedour lunch pack and tried to gather at the entrance. People everywhere,and it was already difficult to get out of the hut. The line of climberspassed right in front of the door. At about 2:00, after a cup of coffee,everybody was ready to queue for the top, and it took some two hours anda couple of minutes to get there. It wasn't too cold on top of Fuji-sanbut windy enough to make you freeze during one hour of waiting. Time forwatching the activities at the shrine: climbers getting stamps, havingtheir sticks burned or buying "Eternal Luck". Finally, the sun showed up- not a very special sunrise, with clouds at the horizon, or special maybebecause hundreds or thousands of people around you are looking in the samedirection? I'm sure everybody's seen better ones before (I suspect thatJapanese and Westerners don't see the same thing watching this sunrise,gomenasai).<p>Immediately after sunrise the crowd started to move - traffic jam aroundthe shops. On our walk along the rim we admired the shadow of Fuji-sanand had breakfast near the weather station. The post office was easy tofind, unfortunately closed since August 20.<br><img SRC="sonnenbrille.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 height=103 width=192 align=LEFT><p>We began our descent on the Gotemba route around 8:00am and had a breakat one of the huts. It's a fast and easy way down; the lower part, stillsteep enough to make you "brake" all the way down, could have been a bitshorter. After a short rest at Gotemba 5th Station, we took Taxis to GotembaStation where we dropped our postcards. Due to a regrettable misunderstandingwe lost track of Hubert who was queueing for his travel information atthe JR counter. We had lunch in a restaurant across the square and tookthe train(s) back home.<br><a href="mailto:gingl@nimc.go.jp"><img SRC="briefkasten.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 BORDER=1 height=70 width=100 align=RIGHT></a><p>What I keep as a souvenir is not the sunrise, but rather the endlesschain of lights heading for the top. Paul Hunt: "Nowadays people climbFuji-san for the fun and challenge of of climbing Japan's highest peak,but a few pilgrims may be seen ...". I've seen a lot of pilgrims, not inthe traditional white clothes and straw sandals, and most of them not evenbeing aware of their "pilgrim" status.<p>Doing this hike outside climbing/pilgrimeering season must be a completelydifferent adventure, and I'm tempted to try that one as well - knowingthat only fools climb Fuji-san more than once. I guess the post man doesn'tcare. Why should I?<p>Many thanks to all the participants, and especially to Miho. I hopeyou all enjoyed this trip as I did.<br><a href="mailto:gingl@nimc.go.jp">Franz</a><p><img SRC="rot_blau.gif" height=5 width=100% align=CENTER><table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 COLS=3 WIDTH="100%" ><tr ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="20%" HEIGHT="155" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><img SRC="stod_bnl.gif" height=105 width=68 align=CENTER></td><td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="0"><center><font color="#000080"><font size=+3><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Gorge/6108/">TWMCHome Page</a></font></font><p><font color="#000080"><font size=+2><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Gorge/6108/">TsukubaWalking &amp;</a></font></font><p><font color="#000080"><font size=+2><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Yosemite/Gorge/6108/">MountaineeringClub</a></font></font></center></td><td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="20%" HEIGHT="155" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><img SRC="stod_bnl.gif" height=105 width=68 align=CENTER></td></tr></table><center><img SRC="rot_blau.gif" height=5 width=100% align=CENTER><p>MT.

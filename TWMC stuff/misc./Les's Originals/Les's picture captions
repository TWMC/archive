Bjoern,Don't die of shock! From top to bottom, left to right:1) Rock climbers on Kitahotaka-dake.2) Sunset from Karasawa-dake looking West.3) Paul and Neil traversing a particularly narrow bit in the col betweenKitahotaka-dake and Minami-dake. The arrow pointing downwards is, it is said,the place where many a tired walker fall to their deaths.4) Paul waiting in a queue on the way to Okuhotaka-dake.5) The view towards Minami-dake and Yari-ga-take from the hut beneathKitahotaka-dake.6) More queues formed by people coming up the easy way to Kitahotaka-dake.7) Neil during the ascent on the first day with the Nishihotaka-dake ridge inthe background.8) The mist starts coming in on the first day - there will be a thunder stormin a few hours!9) More gentle scenery during the descent down the valley from Yari-ga-take toKamikochi on the final day.10) Sunset from Karasawa-dake looking South. Okuhotaka-dake-sansou is in thebottom right of the photograph.11) The Hotaka-Yari ridge is a little steep in places! Paul or Neil can just bemade out on top.

<H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">The &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; has
several functions.</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<H2><CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial">For one, it is meant as a memorial
to distinguished hike organisers, <BR>
including the most embarrassing photos we could find. <BR>
<BR>
There is also a brief history of the TWMC.</FONT></CENTER></H2>

HISTORY (by Paul Reay)</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">As I know that some people
will ask me, here is a little history of the TWMC.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">On 9 March 1998, Kouichi
posted the following mail on TAIRA:</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Dear TAIRAites,</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">&quot;I am looking for
groups that enjoy hiking and backpacking. I am from<BR>
Seattle and have some experiences of these activities. I used
to belong<BR>
to the group called the Mountaineers in Seattle. I would also
like to<BR>
enjoy these activities in Japan. If you know or belong to this
kind of<BR>
groups, please let me know.<BR>
Thank you for your help.<BR>
Kouichi Iwasaki&quot;</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">I like the way he says
that he is from Seattle!!!</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">One of the people who
responded to this mail was John Payne, and a small group<BR>
went walking one weekend shortly after this. I already knew John
at this time,<BR>
and remembered Kouichi's mail, so he told me that he was meeting
Kouichi in<BR>
Tokyo to go to Kouichi's favourite outdoor shop in Yokohama, and
invited me to<BR>
come along. This was on Sunday 26 April, and on the train coming
back home, we<BR>
discussed setting up a walking club and coined the name TWMC.
On Wednesday 29<BR>
April, we had our first meeting in Gold Rush. Four people attended
that<BR>
meeting, and the first committee (Chairman - Kouichi, Secretary
- John,<BR>
Treasurer - me) was formed. On 9 May, John set up the mailing
list, and on 23<BR>
and 24 May, we went for our first walk. Within a couple of weeks,
we were<BR>
completely astonished at the interest we had generated.</FONT></CENTER></P>

Hall of Shame - Injuries</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Luckily, there were no
serious injuries yet on TWMC trips. In fact, only 3 are worth
mentioning.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Paul popped his knee on
the Oze trip of 1998, and he promised to provide MRI scans of
his knee for this page many years ago ...</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Then there is Bj&ouml;rns
fall on the <A HREF="../previous_walks/2001_02_Skiing/DownhillSkiing2001.html">2001
downhill skiing trip</A>. He managed to fall on the easiest part
of <BR>
the easiest slope of the Alts resort on Bandai-san, where in fact
the only difficulty is not to stop.<BR>
It was said that he was looking at some cute Japanese girls but
this account was denied by Bj&ouml;rn. It is <BR>
undeniable, however, that he had a second fall at the very same
place a few descents later when a really <BR>
cute snowboarding girl bumped into him from behind.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Be this as it may, below
is an MRI scan of his right upper arm, a vertical slice from the
front (left) to the back (right). <BR>
After some confusion (the doctors initially scared Bj&ouml;rn
shitless by diagnosing he had torn his rotator cuff) it <BR>
turned out that the arm was &quot;only&quot; broken after all,
though in a somewhat awkward way. You can see that <BR>
a chunk broke out off the upper arm bone opposite to the joint
with the shoulder. The white blob in the <BR>
centre of the image is the bone, the broken out piece is visible
to the upper left of it.</FONT></CENTER></P>

back translation of Bj&ouml;rns name from Katakana into Romaji.
<BR>
Klotz Bj&ouml;rn became Kurotutu Biyorun.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Finally there is Stefans
knee injury at the <A HREF="../previous_walks/2001_07_Kamikochi/Kamikochi2001.html">2001
Kamikochi</A> trip. The MRI scan below doesn't really show anything,
but he had to be flown out by helicopter!</FONT></CENTER></P>

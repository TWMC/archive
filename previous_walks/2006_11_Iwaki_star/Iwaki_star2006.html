		<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000"><b>We had a vareity trip 
		last weekend, climbing a mountain, visiting caves, and walking in a 
		river gorge. And, of course, moon watching in the night (after a 
		gorgeous dinner)!<br>
		<br>
		Three of the participants had to drop out at the last moment, and so we 
		were 11, 9 of us leaving in two cars in the morning, and two carrying 
		telescopes after noon.<br>
		<br>
		It was a net 600 m climb to the top of 1200 m high Takine-san, complete 
		with chains and ladders. Some members complained that it should not have 
		been rated just one star. I considered it and revised the rating to two 
		stars (with immediate effect). After all, most members were drawn to 
		this walk for its one star rating! Camilla completed only one star 
		credit on the first day, but she made up for this shortfall at the river 
		gorge the next day.<br>
		<br>
		After a gala dinner and relaxing bath, we set out in yukatas to set up 
		the telescopes. We had a nice view of the moon, with shades of clouds 
		running across its face like changing emotions. And then we had views of 
		some windows, and could clearly examine the dust and the cracks on them, 
		but nothing through them. A detailed report from James is expected soon.<br>
		<br>
		After a gorgeous breakfast we drove along the river Natsui, stopping at 
		some waterfalls in autumn setting, and finally arriving at the river 
		gorge, well known in our club as &quot;Iwaki waterfalls,&quot; where we make a 
		pilgrimage every summer with Victor. At this time of the year, the top 
		had beginning to color, but the autumn had not set in deeper inside.</b></font></td>

		<font color="#800000">6-7 hours hike, 14 km long. </font><br>
		<br>
&nbsp;<font color="#000080">Beginning to mid of November seems to be well 
		suitable for this hike. The view of Fuji-san can be very clear and color 
		of trees very beautiful.<br>
		<br>
		From Tsukuba the first TX Express train is too late to arrive early 
		enough in Mitsu-toge station.
		Therefore the seven of us went by two cars to Mitsu-touge station, where 
		we left the cars and started to hike. One participant came by train from 
		Tokyo, which is possible if you get up early and change trains several 
		times.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
		We got very beautiful views of Fuji-san, and a panorama view of 
		Yatsu-ga-take, Kita Alps and other surrounding mountains. The descent 
		first led along a ridge with nice glimpse of the lake Kawaguchi-ko. We 
		finished the hike in Kawaguchi-ko town. From there we took a train back 
		to Mitsu-toge station, which takes about 20 min. The trains are quite 
		frequent. In Kawaguchi-ko there are many onsen. We visited the temple 
		onsen, which was quite nice. You can buy a combined bath and dinner 
		ticket. So we also had dinner there, which was good.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;I considered the rating of the hike announcement (** to ***) as 
		appropriate. However, one participant had many difficulties to climb the 
		mountain. Another told me the rating should be rather *** to ****. 
		However, there are no difficulties. It is only a bit steep ascent, no 
		difficulties like climbing, ladders, dangerous parts, therefore I think 
		the announced rating of ** to *** is appropriate.</font></font></td>

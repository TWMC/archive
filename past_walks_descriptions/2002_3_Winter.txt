TWMC Winter 2002/3 Walks Schedule:

"2-3 November: Tanzawa (Kanagawa-ken), 2 days (Paul)"
"Rising abruptly from the Kanto Plain, the Tanzawa Mountains are the nearest"
"peaks over 1,000 metres to the sprawling conurbation of Tokyo and Yokohama."
"With its fine mountain scenery, Tanzawa offers the possibility of year-round"
"walking, and magnificent views of Fuji-san during the colder months. A good"
"place for novice walkers, but some routes offer a challenge even to the more"
experienced. Difficulty: ***.
------------------------------
"16 November: Hirugatake (Yamanashi-ken), 1 day(Kouichi)"
Hiru-ga-take is located in the Five Lakes area near Mt. Fuji. We will start
"walking at Lake Shibiren, and walk up to the top of the mountain, 1,117"
"metres high (3 hours, elevation gain 399 metres). The view from the summit"
"includes the nearby Mt. Fuji, the South Alps, and Yatsu-ga-take. This is an"
"easy walk, but we can still enjoy nice views from the top. This walk would"
be ideal for those who are interested in an introductory hike. More
experienced hikers can choose a trail with an elevation gain of 700 metres.
Difficulty: **.
------------------------------
"30 November: Tsukiore-San (Ibaraki-ken), 1 day(Akira)"
"With views of the impressive Fukuroda Falls, the easy walk up Tsukiore-san"
"is one of the best walking courses in Okukuji, especially during the Autumn."
"The mountain has two peaks, Mae-san and Ushiro-san (423m). We will start"
"walking at Fukuroda Station, and will soon reach Fukuroda Falls, 120 m in"
"height and 73 m in width, before starting the climb of Tsukiore-san (200 m"
"vertical ascent). On the way to the top, we will have good panoramic views"
"with Fukuroda Falls below. Of course, there is an onsen at the end of the"
walk. Difficulty: **.
------------------------------
"14 Dec. - Tsukuba-san/Xmas Party (Tsukuba-city), 1 day(Ajay)"
December 14: Christmas Party
"Traditionally, the Christmas party consists of two parts - a walk up and"
"down the 876 m high Tsukuba-san, and the party itself. The walk is very easy"
"and suitable for everybody, and will start at Tsukuba-san shrine (known for"
"the god of matchmaking!), and will take about 90 minutes up, and the same"
"down, including breaks. If the weather is clear, and in winter it very often"
"is, there may be spectacular views as far as the skyscrapers of Shinjuku,"
"Fuji-san, and the mountains around Nikko. We will go to an onsen after the"
walk and return to Tsukuba for a party.
------------------------------
"11-12 January: Yoro Gorge & Onsen Tour (Bousou Peninsula, Chiba-ken), 2 days"
(Tadashi)
"Escape the freezing, stressful city life to take a long walk in the"
evergreen forest of the warm Boso peninsula in the south of Chiba
prefecture. The area preserves a pristine air thanks to the ruggedness
of the surrounding mountain range despite its low altitude. On top of
"the rich variety of flora, sightings of rare faunae such as squirrels,"
green snakes (harmless) and deer may await you. This is a car-based
two-day trip with an easy walk of 3.5 to 4.5 hours on both days through
"a beautiful valley and a forest, with an overnight stop at a historical"
onsen (hot spring) village. We shall also visit a few ancient temples
(dating back to the 1400's) along the way. Difficulty **.
------------------------------
"25 January: Kaba-san (Ibaraki-ken), 1 day (Masako)"

"Kaba-san (709 m), located just ""behind"" Tsukuba-san, is famous for its"
"religious status, and is known as a place for monks to practice asceticism."
"On this trip, you can enjoy a relatively easy walk, visiting the impressive"
"Rakuhou Temple (Amabiki Kannon), and seeing several miniature shrines along"
the ridge.
------------------------------
"8-9 Feburary: Downhill Skiing (Fukushima-ken), 2 days (Terry)"

The trip is planned for those who are interested in downhill skiing or
"snowboarding in Inawashiro, Fukushima. The resort has a wide range of"
"courses suiting beginners to experts, and, therefore, offers fun for all."
"You will see a beautiful big lake, Inawashiro-ko, down at the bottom while"
"you are skiing, making you feel as if you could jump into the lake!"
------------------------------
"22-23 February: Cross-country Ski Trip , 2 days (Victor)"
Cross-country skiing is a fun way to get out and enjoy Winter. The
"location for this years trip has not been decided, but I will try to"
find a place that is challenging for both beginners and experienced
skiers. Don't worry if you don't have cross-country skis; we can
rent them at the ski area. The TWMC cross-country ski trip is always
"popular, and if you have never tried cross-country skiing, this is a"
good opportunity to learn.
------------------------------
"8 March: Narukami-yama (Ibaraki-ken), 1 day (Ajay)"
"Narukami-yama is located North West of Tsukuba. Consisting of four peaks,"
"the two main East and West peaks, at 980 m and 812 m, respectively, it is"
relatively easy one day walk. We will walk through the deep forest and climb
the East peak first to enjoy the beautiful view of Nantai-san and Akagi-san
"to the North. Old stone shrines, built in Edo period, can also be seen at"
"the top of the peak. Returning, we will also visit the other, smaller peaks."
Difficulty **.
------------------------------
"21-22 March: Mihara-yama (Izu-Oshima, Tokyo-to), 2 days (Akira)"
Mihara-yama (754 m) is an active volcano on Izu-Oshima Island. The volcano
"erupted in 1986, but it is now safe to visit the island. We will catch a"
"ferry at Hamamatsu-cho late evening, and sleep on board overnight until it"
"arrives at Izu-Oshima Island the following morning. From the port, we will"
"catch a bus to the walking path, and walk 3-4 hours to the top. After"
"enjoying the volcano, we will visit Hamano-yu outside onsen, and go back to"
Tsukuba on the same day. Difficulty: ***.
------------------------------
"5 April: Day Walk in Tokyo (Tokyo-to), 1 day (Victor)"
This is not your typical TWMC walk. The idea for this walk is to give
"newcomers to Japan the opportunity to visit Tokyo, and maybe learn how"
"to use the transportation systems. As well, old-timers will have the"
chance to go to places that they haven't been before. The last time
"we did this, the walk was part sight-seeing, part treasure-hunt and"
part game. Who knows what crazy ideas I will come up with for this
year's walk.

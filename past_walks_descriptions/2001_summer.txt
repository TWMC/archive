TWMC Summer walks schedule 2001:
---------------------------------------------------------
April 7-8 Hakone Masako
(Kanagawa-ken)
Hakone was previously a large conical volcano resembling
"the present-day Fuji, but its central part collapsed,"
later activity building the triple volcanic cones which
"are seen today. A land of steaming vents, onsens, and a"
"picturesque lake, this is a moderately easy weekend's"
walking with the striking profile of Fuji-san never far
from view.
---------------------------------------------------------
April 22 Nokogiriyama Tadashi
(Chiba-ken)
A very easy excursion by car to the temple garden on top
of the hill in the warm Chiba peninsula. A famous tourist
"spot with magnificent stone quarries, thousands of Buddhist"
stone figurines and the largest stone Buddha statue in the
"world. An easy stroll, no calories burned."
Will drop by Chiba port for fresh Sashimi/Sushi dinner.
---------------------------------------------------------
May 12-13 Kumotoriyama Paul
(Tokyo)
"Yes, Tokyo! Kumotoriyama, the ""Cloud Grabber"", at 2018"
"metres, is the highest mountain in Chichibutama National"
"Park, the nearest national park to Tokyo, and an ideal"
area for walks in beautiful mountain scenery.
Difficulty: moderate.
---------------------------------------------------------
May 26 Myogisan Iulia
(Nagano-ken)
"1. Valley walk: There is no real difficulty, but a few chains"
to grab. Around 6 hours at normal pace. Beautiful views of
"the upper head jagged ridge, and beautiful rock formations"
"too (gates, needles...)."
2. Ridge walk: Difficulty: somewhat difficult! Map time
is 9 hours. Roughly described as follows: going up in the
"forest (2 hours), following the ridge (5 hours) and coming"
"down through forest again (1h30), and eventually road"
(30 minutes). Astonishing rock formations to observe.
---------------------------------------------------------
June 2-3 Nikko Terry
(Tochigi-ken)
Nikko has more to offer than the temples. The plan is to
"visit the Okukinu-marsh. It is said to be similar to Oze,"
and we are hoping to see the colourful scenery of
early-summer flowers.
---------------------------------------------------------
June 9 or 16 or 23 BBQ party (Tsukuba) Victor
precise date depending on the weather
---------------------------------------------------------
June 30 - July 1 Naeba-yama Masako
(Nagano/Niigata-ken)
Naeba-yama has the reputation of a mountain paradise. On
its peculiar plateau-like summit there is a marsh and
"scattered ponds shining like mirrors, appearing like a rice"
"field for a god. The name ""Naeba"" means a nursery for rice,"
and Naeba-yama was a religious mountain for the local
people who prayed for a good harvest. This walk of moderate
difficulty visits the mountain at the time of year when it
is best to see the many plants and flowers in bloom on its
summit.
---------------------------------------------------------
July 8 Ryujinkyo Terry
(Ibaraki-ken)
An easy valley walk in Ibaraki. You also could just do
some bouldering along the river with its waterfalls.
---------------------------------------------------------
July 20-22 Kamikochi Paul
(Kita Alps)
Situated in the noble splendour and magnificence of the
"Kita Alps, a visit to Kamikochi, the ""birthplace of"
"Japanese alpinism"", is a ""must-do"". Two walks, one"
"including ""the"" apline route to do in Japan from Hotakadake"
"to the spear-like Yarigatake, and the other from Nakabusa"
"Onsen along the ""Ginza Traverse"" (Ginza Juusou) to"
"Yarigatake, offer superb ridge trails for different"
levels of ability.
---------------------------------------------------------
August 5 Iwaki waterfall walk + BBQ Victor
(Fukushima-ken)
A leisurely 4 hour circular walk up a small river with
many waterfalls and ample chance for baths in the pools
"below them. Difficulty: Easy, though there are some"
ladders and chains. Traditionally the TWMCs most popular
walk.
---------------------------------------------------------
August 17-19 Yatsugatake Paul
(Nagano/Yamanashi-ken)
"According to ancient legend, Yatsugatake was once higher"
"than Fuji, but Fuji rose and kicked its rival over, forming"
eight lower peaks. There are actually more than eight peaks
"along the jagged north-south ridge, most of which is over"
"2,500 metres, which forms the border between Nagano and"
Yamanashi-ken. Allowing three days to complete this walk
over Yatsugatake's highest peaks and most spectacular
"scenery, the pace will not be particularly hurried, but"
"many situations could prove interesting. In walking terms,"
that's a euphemism for difficult!
---------------------------------------------------------
September 8 Mitakesan Iulia
(Tokyo)
"Mitake-san is located in the mountains South from Tokyo,"
easy to reach by train. Indicated as a day-trip from Tokyo
it will need an early start from Tsukuba. The ridge offers
"a nice view of the fragmented, forest covered scenery; in"
good weather Tanzawa and Fuji-san will appear to reward the
hikers. On Mitake-san there is a famous old shrine and around
it a much newer on tourists focused village.
The walk is somewhat strenuous (6.5 h map time) but not
"Technically difficult. The first part (starting from Okutama,"
ca. 300 m) is quite steep but after reaching the highest peak
"- Odake-san (1267 m) - the path goes along a ridge,"
descending smoothly over Mitake-san to Kori train station.
---------------------------------------------------------
September 22-23 Bandai-san Bjoern
(Fukushima-ken)
An active volcano some 3-4 hours driving to the north of
Tsukuba. A very beautiful mountain with a crater lake.
Difficulty: easy to medium.
---------------------------------------------------------
"September 29-30 or Fuji-san, 2 days Tadashi"
October 6-8 or depending on the weather
October 13-14 
An opportunity to climb Fuji (3776m) outside the season
when there's no crowd. Not overly strenuous but a pretty
good exercise for the heart and the lungs. Take a nap at
"the 5th station hut, then climb steadily to avoid mountain"
sickness. Hopefully reach the summit by sunrise. It is
"said that every man should climb Fuji-san once in his life,"
but only a fool climbs it twice. This may very well be the
"7th TWMC trip to Fuji-san (including unofficial ones),"
so watch out for the fools!

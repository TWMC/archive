TWMC Winter 2001/2 Walks Schedule:

"Oct. 20-21: Naka-no-dake (Niigata-ken), 2 days. (Masako)"
"In previous days, three mountains were regarded as the symbol of the Uonuma"
"area. Naka-no-dake, located in the middle of the three, is the highest peak"
among them.
"The approach to Naka-no-dake will be quite long, climbing up to the"
ridge and staying at the emergency hut there for the night. On the second
"day, the ridge trail leads through grassland-like peaks to the 2,085 m peak"
of Naka-no-dake.
"On the way, we will see the first drop of the Tone river which"
"provides water for the Kanto plain. From Naka-no-dake, it is a steep rocky"
climb down to the parking area. Due to the altitude difference (approx.
"1,600 m) and distance, it will be a tough walk, but this circular route will"
"allow you to fully enjoy the panoramic views from the ridge, in the"
autumnal colours.
"Map time: 1st day 6 hours, 2nd day 8 hours; difficulty:****"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Nov. 4, Sun.: Nemoto-san (Tochigi-ken), 1 day (Paul)"
"Nemoto-san (1,199 m), situated in the Kiryu region south of Nikko, where you"
"are more likely to see bears than people, is a sacred mountain associated"
"with the Black Tengu and samurai, with a notoriety as a place for gambling."
"On the, perhaps, little dangerous route to the summit, is Nemoto shrine, an"
"amazing wooden structure perched high above a cliff, and closer to the"
"summit there are original tsuga (reddish pines), quite unique to Japan. With"
"dense mixed forest and thick bamboo grass in places, the route may be"
difficult to follow. Map time: 5 1/2 hours; difficulty: ***.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Nov. 23-24, Fri.-Sat.: Tanzawa (Kanagawa-ken), 2 days (Tadashi)"
"Rising abruptly from the Kanto Plain, the Tanzawa Mountains are the nearest"
"peaks over 1,000 metres to the sprawling conurbation of Tokyo and Yokohama."
"With its fine mountain scenery, Tanzawa offers the possibility of year-round"
"walking, and magnificent views of Fuji-san during the colder months. A good"
"place for novice walkers, but some routes offer a challenge even to the more"
experienced. Difficulty: ***.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Dec. 8, Sat.: Christmas Party"
Tsukuba-san walk (Victor)
Party (Iulia)
"Traditionally, the Christmas party consists of two parts - a walk up and"
down the 876 m high Tsukuba-san (organised by Victor) and the party itself
(this year at Iulia's place). The walk is very easy and suitable for
"everybody, and will start at Tsukuba-san shrine (known for the god of"
"matchmaking!), and will take about 90 minutes up, and the same down,"
"including breaks. If the weather is clear, and in winter it very often is,"
"there may be spectacular views as far as the skyscrapers of Shinjuku,"
"Fuji-san to the south, and the mountains around Nikko to the north."
We will go to an onsen after the walk.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Jan. 19, Sat.: Kaba-san (Ibaraki-ken), 1 day (Terry)"

"Kaba-san (709 m), located just ""behind"" Tsukuba-san, is famous for its"
religious status and is known as a place for monks to practice asceticism.
"On this trip, you can enjoy a relatively easy walk, seeing several miniature"
shrines along the ridges.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Feb. 2-3: Cross Country Ski Trip, 2 days (Luc or Victor)"
Destination to be decided. There may also be the possibility of snowshoeing
and downhill skiing on this trip
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Feb. 16-17: Downhill Ski Trip (Inawashiro area, Fukushima-ken), 2 days"
(Terry)
There are many skiing resorts near the Bandai-san area. We will visit one or
two skiing resorts (Inawashiro etc.) which have slopes to suit all so that
everybody from beginners to experts can enjoy downhill skiing and/or snow
boarding.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Mar. 10, Sun.: Takao-san (Tokyo-to), 1 day (Paul)"
"This range of low mountains, with peaks below 1,000 metres, offers"
"year-round walking to Tokyo's millions. With its well laid out paths, it is"
"an excellent area to get a first taste of walking in Japan, or for more"
experienced walkers to keep fit. The walk will coincide with the
"fire-walking ceremony (Hiwatari Matsuri) at Yakuou Temple, situated near the"
Summit of Takao-san (600 m). Difficulty: *.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Mar. 23-24: Izu Peninsula (Shizuoka-ken), 2 days (Bjoern)"
Izu is the peninsula to the west of Tokyo and roughly south of Fuji-san.
"It is characterised by a mild winter climate, numerous onsens and a special"
variety of sakura (cherry) trees.
The first day will take us to the highest part of Izu. The plan is to walk
"the not overly undulating ridge encompassing Mansaburou-dake (1,406m) and"
"Manjirou-dake (1,300m). If the weather plays along there should be very nice"
views of Fuji-san.
The second day will see an easy stroll along the seashore at the
southernmost tip of Izu. This area should be the most remote part of the
"peninsula, with nice views of the shore. We will visit onsens on both days."
Difficulty: **

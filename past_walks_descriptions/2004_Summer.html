Although no higher than 600m, the trail takes us over the steep cliffs of
Iwadono san, whose natural fortifications made it an obvious site for a
castle in the Sengoku period. One 100m sheer cliff called Chigo Otoshi
apparently takes its name from an occasion when the castle was defeated and
the lord's wife threw her child off the cliff before jumping herself rather
than face capture by the enemy! This is an easy walk with a combination of
marked and rough trails, and with chains in places. There are fine views,
including of Mount Fuji, and a profusion of spring flowers including
mountain azalea will add colour to the scenery.  It is ideal for novices,
and should be a good way to get in the mood for some more adventurous walks
to follow during the summer.

Mount Bandai is popularly known as the 3Mt Fuji of Aizu2. Comprised of three
peaks (O-bandai, Akatsuchi-yama, and Kushigamine), Bandai-san is a conically
shaped volcano with its skirts elegantly extending to the north of Lake
Inawashiro. It last erupted in 1888 when it flung 1,600 million cubic yards
of its summit material so high into the air it buried many villages in the
Nagase valley. Lava from Bandai-san's eruption stopped streams and
dramatically changed the landscape, creating an area of beautifully coloured
lakes and a large plateau. From the summit (1,819 m) nice views of
Adatarayama, the Atsuma mountain ranges, and Inawashiro-lake can be seen.

The area of Koshin-san (1,999 m) is wild enough to see wild deer near the
mountain hut if you are lucky. The walk includes both a thrilling ridge walk
using fixed ladders and chains near the summit, and a valley walk in a
beautiful forest. We will stay at a mountain hut with no food service, but
which has futons (no sleeping bag is required).

You want a serious hike? You will certainly like this one! This hike will
climb one of the highest peaks near Nikko, Nyoho-san. We will camp near the
summit, and enjoy more peaks on the second day. As we will start from Nikko
(620 m) and climb Nyoho-san (2,300m) you should expect to be tired at the
top... Various routes are possible on the second day depending on how tired
we are. One of the passes along our way is called "Fuji-view pass", which
tells you a lot about the fine views we can expect! Good boots are
absolutely necessary for this hike, and beginners will not be accepted.

Kinpu-san (2,598m) locates in Chichibu-Tama National Park on the border of
Yamanashi-ken and Nagano-ken, and it is the highest mountain in
Oku-chichibu, the western region of the reserve. In olden times many people
visited this mountain for religious reasons, but now more people are
attracted by it's rocky ridge and beautiful native forest. From the top
there are nice views of Yatsu-ga-take, the Minami Alps, and neighbouring
mountains.

Although not quite as grand as the Kita or Minami Alps, the Chuo Alps offer
some excellent walking along granite peaks and ridges adorned with liberal
splashes of alpine flowers. The first day can be hard for some - a 2,000
metre ascent through beautiful forest from Komagane to our night's
accommodation at Koma-mine-hutte. The second day incorporates a magnificent
ridge walk between two peaks, Utsugi-dake (2,864 m) and Kiso-koma-ga-take
(2,931 m), that are included in Fukada Kyuuya's 100 Famous Mountains.
Although the walk should not be undertaken lightly, the undulating ridge,
not dropping below 2,500 m, is not particularly difficult.

Minami Aizu is an area that is rich in untouched nature, with lots of
mountains and hot springs, as well as historical monuments. In this two-day
event we will enjoy the beauty of Minami Aizu by hiking and cycling. On the
first day we will be climbing Nanatsu-ga-take (1,636 m), which has seven
small ridges. From the summit there are panoramic views of Aizu-komagatake,
Aizu-asahi dake, and Arukami-yama. On the second day we will enjoy the
scenery of Minami Aizu by bicycle. The finishing point of the cycling trail
will be at Ouchijuku, an historical place. In the Edo period, Ouchijuku was
a national route, which connected Aizu-wakakmatsu and Nikko, and a place to
find many ryokans. Traditional old houses made up of straw roofs can be seen
there. We will also be spending some time in that historical location.

Kamikochi, situated in the noble splendour and magnificence of the Kita
Alps, is regarded as the birthplace of Japanese alpinism. It is also the
base for some of the best and most rewarding hiking in Japan, and is best
suited for those with reasonable fitness. There will be at least two walk
options converging on the spear-like Yari-ga-take, one including "the"
alpine route to do in Japan along the Hotaka-Yari ridge, and another from
Yarimi Onsen over Kasa-ga-dake. Both of them offer superb ridge trails.
Note: Includes first full weekend in August + one more working day (total: 3
days). Difficulty: **** to *****

The Iwaki Waterfall Walk is one of the most popular hikes every year. It is
a beautiful and easy
walk through a river gorge in Fukushima Prefecture. Along the path are about
10 to 12 waterfalls.
There are also many clear pools below the falls for anyone interested in
going for a swim. This walk
is classified as easy to moderate (**). There are some fixed chains and
ladders and a couple of
steep (but not dangerous) slopes. Walking time is about 4 hours.
Following the walk, weather permitting, we will have a barbeque in the area.

When you speak about Japan one of the first questions people ask you is,
"Did you see Mount Fuji?". You can certainly answer "Yes", but when comes
the next question, "Did you climb it?", what do you reply? As in other
years, TWMC will offer you the opportunity to see Japan at its top, and to
enjoy the sunrise there. Although Fuji-san is the highest mountain in Japan
(3,776 m), climbing it is not very difficult due to its conical shape, but
breathing can become more difficult near the summit due to the lower air
pressure. The date of this hike may be shifted in case of bad weather.

The Shirakami Mountain Range, which runs along the border between Akita and
Aomori Prefectures, and contains Japan's largest virgin beech forest, was
registered as a "World Heritage Natural Resource" in 1993, along with the
other natural heritage, Yakushima island. The Shirakami Mountains extend
over 450 sq. km, and comprise a maze of steep sided hills with summits lying
between 1,000-1,200m. Mountains in this region include Mt Mukai-shirakami
(1,121 m) on the prefectural border. Although there are few roads,
foot-paths, or man made structures within the site, approximately 3,000
people a year climb Mount Futasumori (1,086m), on the border of the core
zone. Siebold's beech (Buna, Fagus crenata) is typical in this Japanese
temperate forest, and many hikers visit here for the beautiful autumnal
yellow leaves. For more information, visit these sites <A HREF="http://www.wcmc.org.uk/protected_areas/data/wh/shira.html ">in English</A> /

What is your image of hiking? Panoramic views from a ridge? Trees and birds
in the forest? This walk may change your mind, and may even change your
impression of mountains. Instead of climbing on a trail, we will follow the
Nukubi-sawa rapids beside/inside the water until its origin, with several
waterfalls on the way. Chains are fixed in the most severe places, but not
all the slippery parts are supported. After we reach the origin, we will
climb up to the main trail toward the peak of Makihata-yama (1,967m). As
opposed to the bit nerve-wrecking former half, we will be able to enjoy a
relaxing grassy ridge near the peak. The current plan is to stay at Egashira
camping site along the ridge (which means you have to carry your sleeping
bag, food and tent), and visit one more mountain (Oeboshi-yama, 1,820m) on
the second day. I may shorten the plan to one day depending on the
participants' preference. Map time: 8.5 hrs for the first day, and 11.5 hrs
for the second day. Difficulty: ***** (**** if the plan is shortened).

If you are interested in walking through marshland surrounded by colourful
leaves and a picturesque lake, you will definitely enjoy this hike. The Oze
district is a wilderness area at 1,650 m in altitude, composed of a lake
(Oze-numa), and marshland (Oze-ga-hara). The marsh was formed as a result of
a lava flow from the volcanic Hiuchi-ga-take (2,356 m) whose soaring peak
dominates the marshes blocking the upper part of the valley. The edge of the
marshes and lower mountain slopes are forested with silver birch, beech and
conifers, but the higher slopes and peaks are above the tree line in the
alpine zone. If we are lucky enough, a variety of wildlife may also be seen
in the area, including deer, squirrels, and chipmunks. On this hike we will
walk through the marshland, as well as climb the highest peak in the Touhoku
area, Hiuchi-ga-take (2,356 m). Views from the peak of the wetland covered
with splendid colours will be a wonderful Autumn scene.

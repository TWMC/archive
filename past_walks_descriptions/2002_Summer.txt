"Kumotori-yama (2018 m), the ""Cloud Grabber"", at 2018 metres, is the highest"

"A local walk, including a visit to Wagakuni-san (518 m) and Atago-jinja,"
"with excellent views across to Tsukuba-san, Kasumi-ga-ura, and the Kantou"
"Plain. The walk goes through beautiful native forests, and there are"
numerous wild flowers on the way. Difficulty: *.

25/26 May 25 (1 day): Myogi-san (Gunma-ken)
"Whether you choose the easy or difficult option, there are astonishing rock"
formations of gates and needles to be observed on Myogi-san. 1) Valley walk:
"A few chains to grab, but nothing to worry about, with beautiful views up to"
the jagged ridge. Difficulty: **. 2) Ridge walk: With plenty of chains and
"exposure, people who enjoy scrambling will have a lot of fun. Difficulty:"
****.
------------------------------
8-9 June (2 days): Asahi-dake (Fukushima-ken)
Asahi-dake (1903m) is one of the peaks that make up the Nasu mountain range
where the crown prince and princess are said to vacation regularly. The
paths from the ropeway station are relatively well maintained. The views
"from the summit are gorgeous all round if blessed with good weather, with"
the active Chausu volcano to the south. Vegetation along the way may also be
noteworthy. Then a long gentle descent will take us down to Kita-onsen for a
dip in a large open-air onsen that resembles a school swimming pool. This
walk can be done at a somewhat brisk pace in one day if we start very early
"in the morning. However, there is another option of making it a relaxing two"
day walk with a stop-over at Santo-goya Onsen which used to be a busy
lodging village in olden days before the mechanised means of transport came
into being. The hut there is a rarely preserved 130 year old large sturdy
"wooden structure, and is a cross between a mountain hut and a ryokan,"
equipped with a small onsen to boot. The difficulty of the walk will be
"between ** and ***, with the course times 4 hrs for the first day and 5 hrs"
for the second day.
------------------------------
22 June (1 day): Kinpu-san (Yamanashi-ken/Nagano-ken)
"Kinpu-san (2599 m), located on the border of Nagano-ken and Yamanashi-ken,"
"is a big mountain in the Okuchichibu range. In old times, many people"
"visited this mountain for religious reasons, but now more people are"
attracted by its rocky ridge together with beautiful native forest. We will
"take the most popular trail from Masutomi onsen, walk through the forest,"
"and climb up to the ridge with views of Yatsu-ga-take, the Minami Alps, and"
neighboring mountains. Difficulty: ***.
------------------------------
30 June: BBQ with world cup final! (Tsukuba-shi)
This is the annual Summer barbeque for the TWMC. This year is special in
that the date of the BBQ coincides with the World Cup final game. We will
"meet for food and beverages on the AIST Campus/in Douhou Kouen, and will"
then move on to watch the final game of the World Cup in Hot Stuff.
------------------------------
6-7 July (2 days): Chuo Alps (Nagano-ken)
An ideal walk for those who want to enjoy high alpine scenery without any of
the sweat of climbing through the forest. The Koma-ga-take Ropeway whisks
"you up 950 metres to within 400 metres of the summit of Koma-ga-take, the"
highest peak in the range. From Koma-ga-take it's a great ridge walk to
"another of Japan's Top 100 Mountains, Utsugi-dake, before a descent through"
beautiful forest. Difficulty: ***.
------------------------------
20 July (1 day): Okukuji (Ibaraki-ken)
Okukuji is located in the north of Ibaraki near the famous Fukuroda Falls.
"The plan is to climb up to one of the highest peaks, Nantai-san (654 m). In"
"spite of its relatively low elevation, you will be able to enjoy an exciting"
walk partly on rocky cliffs. Difficulty: **.
------------------------------
27-29 July (3 days): Kamikochi (Kita Alps)
"Situated in the noble splendour and magnificence of the Kita Alps, a visit"
"to Kamikochi, the ""birthplace of Japanese alpinism"", is a ""must-do"". At"
"least two walks converging on the spear-like Yari-ga-take, one including"
"""the"" apline route to do in Japan along the Hotaka-Yari ridge, and another"
"from Nakabusa Onsen along the ""Ginza Traverse"" (Ginza Juusou), offer superb"
ridge trails for different levels of ability. Difficulty: *** to *****.
------------------------------
10 August (1 day): Iwaki waterfall walk (Fukushima-ken)
This one day trip is one of the most popular walks in the TWMC. The walk is
"in the Natsugawa River valley (close to Iwaki, Fukushima). The first part of"
the walk is through a lovely river gorge with many waterfalls as well as
pools where the courageous (and the insane) can go for a swim. The second
part of the walk goes through the forest and takes us back to the parking
"lot. Although the walk is not strenuous, there are some chains and ladders."
The rating for this walk is one and a half stars.
------------------------------
The official climbing season! (2 days): Fuji-san
(Shizuoka-ken/Yamanashi-ken)
Fuji-san (3776 m) is the most famous and highest mountain in Japan. It is
also one of Japan's most famous symbols because of its almost perfect
"volcanic cone. Climbing Fuji-san is technically relatively easy, along"
"volcanic stony paths, but can be difficult because of the altitude gain and"
"height of the volcano. There is no fixed date for this walk, and it will go"
ahead sometime in the official walking season when the weather looks good
(climbing Fuji-san in bad weather is really horrible... ).
------------------------------
24-25 August (2 days): Houou Sanzan (Yamanashi-ken)
One of the best routes in the South Alps! We will walk along the ridge over
three famous mountains. An alpine meadow and spectacular views will welcome
"us at the ridge. Jizou-dake has a sharp, rocky obeliskoid peak, a famous"
"symbol of the South Alps. The highest peak is Kan-non-dake at 2840 metres,"
"and the elevation gain of the hike is 1770 metres, making it one of the most"
"strenuous hikes this Summer, but it is worth joining!"
------------------------------
14-16 September (3 days): Dewa Sanzan (Yamagata-ken)
"Dewa Sanzan consists of three religious mountains, Gassan (1980 m),"
"Yudono-san (1500 m), and Haguro-san (414 m), in Yamagata-ken, but derive"
their name from the old province of Dewa. Mountain priests have been
practicing asceticism in this area for 1400 years to gain spiritual power
"from nature. This tradition succeeds to the present day. Not only priests,"
but also many members of the public visit here to purify themselves. We will
"climb Gassan, the highest of the three peaks, to enjoy the view of the Japan"
"Sea from its beautiful grassland-like peak, and will also visit two other"
mountains to complete this cultural experience. Difficulty: ***.
------------------------------
28-29 September (2 days): Oze (Gumna-ken/Nigata-ken/Fukushima-ken)
Oze is a very famous high (above 1500 metres) wetland in Japan. We will
"enjoy the colourful leaves of Autumn. On the first day, we will walk through"
"the wetland, which has a very specialized flora. On the second day, we will"
"climb up to the highest peak in the Touhoku area, Hiuchi-dake (2356 m). The"
view of the wetland covered with pretty colours from the peak should be one
of the best Autumn scenes. The elevation gain is 1166 meters.
Difficulty:***.
------------------------------
5-6 or 12-14 October (2 days): Tanigawa-dake (Gunma-ken/Nigata-ken)
Tanigawa-dake (1974 m) is known as one of the most dangerous spots for
"mountaineering in Japan. However, it only holds for the the Ichinokura-sawa"
"area, a popular spot for rock climbers. You can safely enjoy hiking to see"
beautiful autumnal colours along popular trails. In spite of its relatively
"low elevation, the climate there is almost equivalent to that of 3000 metre"
"level mountains, so wrap up warm! Difficulty: **."
